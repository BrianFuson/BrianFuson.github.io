    <h3>About</h3>
    <hr style="height:3px;background-color:black"> 
    <p>I thrive on solving difficult problems in unique ways. My name is Brian Fuson, and I will be graduating with a BFA in graphic design in May ’25. I have found interest in type design, photography, illustration, motion design, and some coding. One of my favorite things about graphic design, is the ability to take your work and make it real; have other people enjoy and experience it. I like it so much that I took up coding to create websites from scratch. I love exploring with design as an art form as I chalk each one of my projects up as an experiment and am not afraid to sail in unknown waters. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
    <p>My baby (other than my cat, Frank) is my type foundry called Fusion Type. Fusion Type is an independent type foundry that I created officially in January 2025. I found my love for typography through my major. Working unique fonts into my designs soon became my addiction. It didn’t take long before I was spending every minute outside of classes working on type projects to figure out how the greats did it. The typeface design process is simply like no other and I was hooked. I developed many bad designs, but each iteration was better as I learned. I soon came to the point that I was able to make what I imagined. My amazing professors soon caught on to my nasty habit of spending more time on personal type projects than my homework. They awarded this behavior with an “Entrepreneurial Promise” award. I used the awarded funds to take an online intro to type design course at The Letterform Archive. I developed Bookwell during this course. I love this platform, and it is so freeing to do work where I’m the boss and grunt.</p>
