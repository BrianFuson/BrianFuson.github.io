    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Brian Fuson. I am a graphic design major at The University of Tennessee Knoxville and am graduating in May 2025. I am passionate about design to an extent I never thought before college. Simply put, creating things is what drives me as a person. I thrive on solving difficult problems in unique ways. I have found interest in type design, photography, illustration, motion, and everything in between. One of my favorite things about graphic design, is the ability to take your work and make it real. I enjoy exploring with my designs as I chalk each one of my projects up as an experiment to improve from. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed creating it. </p>
