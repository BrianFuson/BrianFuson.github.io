      <h3>Honey Bee Zoo Exhibit</h3>
      <img src="/images/HB2.jpg" alt="Honey Bee Zoo Exhibit" style="width: 100%" />
      <p>
        This project was a student research project funded by Honey Bee Tennessee taking place in the Knoxville Zoo. The plan for the exhibit was to have many images of bees consisting of illustrations and photography. This exhibit is in the Kids Cove part of the zoo, so I wanted to keep the graphics appealing to children. I got the idea to include childrenâ€™s drawings as the main imagery of the outside of the exhibit. I reached out to Linden Elementary School in Oak Ridge, Tennessee to start a
        bee drawing contest with the winners being featured. I received over 100 drawings. I then masked each drawing out and put it on a crayon background. In addition to the drawings, flat color and bee image tiles were created. These were printed out on PVC signs and hung on the inside and outside of the building.
