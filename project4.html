<p>One day, while scrolling Tiktok, I saw a design contest for The North Face. I knew I had to submit. I ended up with a scene of the dome rock in Yosemite park that The North Face logo is based on. The copy on the shirt combines their mantra and their brand name in a font I created based on street signs in my home town (I think I'm calling it Okay Oaky). A month or so later, they reached out to me informing me that my design was selected. This shirt will be released in their upcoming season. I received $1,500 in prizes as an award!</p>
<p>My University even caught wind of this project and wrote a little article about me! Click the button to read about it!</p>
