<p>Green Grass Global is a branding project I did in my GRDS 471 class. Green Grass Global is an organization that wants to improve mental health through house plants. I wanted to create something that utilized more raster than vector graphics. I did this by using hand lettering almost everywhere, and some expressive type for the rest. Aside from that, the style is very much art nouveau. Photography is also a big part of this system. Since the brand promotes plants, plant photography is important. I created a mock Instagram filter to tie everything in. It would be available to everyone and used to create interest around house plants. Overall, I think that his brand is strong visually, but it is missing some context. That is where the mission statement comes in.  </p>
<p>Mental health is an epidemic that only worsens by the day. Out of all American adults, 23% of them have mental health issues. What if there was a medicine that has almost no downsides? What if the medicine does not affect your day-to-day life in the way that other prescription drugs do? What if you get a house plant? Green Grass Global is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to vouch for the validity of house plant’s improvement on day to day life. Starting with hospitals, researchers found that simply putting plants in waiting rooms improved patients well-being. The best part of this is that plants are cheap and easy to maintain. Other researchers also concluded that there is more evidence every day that plants play an integral role in providing higher quality of living environments. During COVID-19, when overall mental health was at an all-time low, a study concluded that both indoor and outdoor greenery lowered depressive and anxiety symptoms. It is no question that bringing life into your indoor space helps improve mental health. Plants not only are a part of this group, but also significantly help. If you are suffering from any mental illness, simply interacting with indoor plants on top of your current treatment can reduce physiological and psychological stress, one study found. Green Grass Global exists as a safe place for plant lovers to show off their loved ones. Through collective participation from all Green Grass Global’s members, we feature unique plants in unique greenhomes. This is all to encourage others to adopt a plant or two to help with mental health. If you grow a plant, it will help you in unappreciated ways. After all, what grows around, comes around.</p>
