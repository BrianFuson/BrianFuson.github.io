    <h3>Type Designs</h3>
    <p>Type design is something that vastly appeals to me. The idea of creating a system of forms to either pass off to someone else or use myself is challenging. Creating a set of letters that work well together is an addiction of some sort. I am lucky to have met kind people to critique my work, but other than that I am self taught through various latin type design resources online. I recently launched an independent type foundry called Fusion Type selling my work. More information about that process is on the page!</p>
