      Type One Digest is a multidisciplinary design project focused on reimagining the way people interact with information about Type 1 Diabetes. Instead of relying on cold, clinical visuals and overwhelming data, this project centers the lived experience of diabetics through approachable, engaging, and human-focused design. It combines research, interviews, and creative development to craft a resource that feels less like a medical manual and more like a supportive companion. The project lives
      online as a website I coded and includes infographics and printed materials that are all created with bright visuals, clear messaging, and emotional awareness.

      Important elements include a mascot named Pablo, a friendly blue bird who brings personality to serious content, and tools like a 118-factor blood sugar chart, printable logbooks, anatomy illustrations, and historical timelines. Type One Digest also explores the potential for future physical expansions, such as AI-powered carb-counting apps and ambient glucose displays. At its core, this project is about shifting the tone of diabetic education from sterile to personal. Itâ€™s built for the
      person, not just the disease. By prioritizing flexibility, empathy, and design that invites curiosity, Type One Digest helps make diabetes management feel a little more human and a little less lonely.

      EURECA is an annual event through the University of Tennessee, Knoxville that allows students to showcase their work to people across all disciplines. As a graphic designer, I felt a little out of place. What I did not expect was to resonate with so many people. The judges were a fan of my project, but what really stood out to me was a nice lady that I talked to. Her son has been a type one diabetic for some time and she thought the approach was fresh. She agreed that the sterileness of
      most current infographics is overwhelming. The fact that this would be useful to at least one other person makes this endeavor worth it. At the end of the event, I was awarded a second place in my design category.
