    <p>This zine is a document of what I accomplished during my undergrad. This is a quote from Fusion Type Presents Undergraduate Specimen Zine that describes this whole project.</p>
    <p>
      “I found a love for typography and eventually type design during my undergrad. My degree is in graphic design, so naturally I surrounded myself with cool type. I made so many bad fonts before I even knew what I was doing. I started taking the type design process seriously during my third semester. I started bothering respected designers for critique and eventually took a class through the Letterform Archive. I then started my own independent type foundry called Fusion Type. This is where I
      publish fonts that I believe to be done. This zine is a collection of published and unfinished fonts I created during my undergraduate program.”
    </p>
    <p>I then reached out to Draw Down Books and asked if they would carry my title. Draw Down (Kathleen and Christopher Sleboda) did a workshop during my second year at UTK that I attended and they have been supportive and in touch since then. They accepted and you can buy yours (given stock) at the button below!</p>
